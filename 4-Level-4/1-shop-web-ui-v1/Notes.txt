Arch.. issues
----------------------

===> state/model/ui-data is scattered across UI components
===> state & state-change logic & network/service calls 
     are tightly-coupled with UI components
===> if same state is required in multiple components 
     either we should duplicate that state in components or we should pass via input properties 
===> Unit-Testing is very difficult in components
===> we cant re-use same components across diffent pages or applications




soln:

   ==> isolate common state & state change logic & n/wing logic 
       from UI components


    How ?

    soln-1 : using MVC arch

    soln-2 : using Flux Arch
